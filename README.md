# Bumblebee Simulator

Welcome to Bumblebee Simulator, a native device application built using React Native. With this colorful application, you can simulate different "buzz" patterns, just like the venerable bumblebee itself.

## Using this application:

1. Follow the live link to the Expo Snack [here](https://snack.expo.io/@alex-whan/bumblebee-simulator).

2. When prompted, tap the "Open with Expo" option to open the application (NOTE: You must have the "Expo" application installed on your phone in order for this to work).

3. The app will ask for permission for your location. Please allow grant it in order to continue.

4. You have 4 different options on the screen, each of which will trigger a different vibration pattern:

- `Buzz`: Vibrates a single time.
- `Buzz Buzz Buzz`: Vibrates three times in a row.
- `Buzzzzzzzzzzz`: Vibrates repeatedly until you hit the `That's Enough` button.
- `That's Enough`: Cancels any ongoing vibration.

5. Tap a "buzz" pattern option to get started!
