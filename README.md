# Bumblebee Simulator

Welcome to Bumblebee Simulator, a native device application built using React Native. With this colorful application, you can simulate different "buzz" patterns, just like the venerable bumblebee itself.

## Using this application:

1. Follow the live link to the Expo Snack [here](https://snack.expo.io/@alex-whan/bumblebee-simulator).

2. The app will ask for permission for your location. Please allow grant it in order to continue.

3. You have 4 different options on the screen, each of which will trigger a different vibration pattern:

- `Buzz`: Vibrates a single time.
- `Buzz Buzz Buzz`: Vibrates three times in a row.
- `Buzzzzzzzzzzz`: Vibrates repeatedly until you hit the `That's Enough` button.
- `That's Enough`: Cancels any ongoing vibration.

4. Tap a "buzz" pattern option to get started!
